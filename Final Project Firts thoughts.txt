 Proof of concept:
             1.        A database driven web application using MVC

The Idea is to buil the prood of concept for a dietary program. 
Program your eating habits. Base in the existing ground diets types.

You will be able to :

A) Create a new Program with these parameters:

-Name your habit (program)
-Set a time or goal frame of time to archive 
this training habit (expect nor necessary obligatory)

- Set a list of ingredientes to check on your list 
- would be good if an open api with 
the content of producsts or veggies to add.
(add manually in case not existance)

- Description of you own diet.
- Write clear your expectancy to archive. for exemple. loss weight or clean your gut.

B) Already set up programs that exist in a list.

C) Programs should send a sort of remainning message.

D) You should have a page for user.
   We should provide logging credentials.

E) it should have a instant feeback form for the users.

This prove of concept should use database driven.
use and api with vegetales properties or other products

Proof of Concept? well!
Step 1: Prove the Need -new feuture 
or way of thinking about diets and programs have come.

Step 2: Map Pain Points to Solutions and Get Feedback
List of solutions, go back to the users and 
stakeholders you initially interviewed and learn 
their reactions and responses to the recommended solutions.
Describe how you envision the product working, 
and ask for their feedback.
This input will provide you with 
valuable insight as you move forward.

Step 3: Prototype Your Solution and Test UI/UX
Record their use of the product to track 
how intuitive the interface really is,
and find out if you overlooked any important functionality.
resonates with users and stakeholders

Step 4: Create a Minimum Viable Product - An MVP
Resonates with users and stakeholders???
MVP should inclued a direct feetback of all functions and views.

Step 5: Design a Roadmap
roadmap as a set of blueprints for constructing a building.
clear goal.
